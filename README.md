## Intro
This project aims to investigate the sales data of a pizza restaurant using SQL. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, such as sales volume, customer preferences, and product performance, we can gain valuable insights into the restaurant's business operations and identify areas for improvement.
## Objectives
- **Analyze sales trends:** Identify patterns in sales data over time, including peak sales periods and seasonal variations.
- **Evaluate product popularity:** Determine the most and least popular pizza items and their corresponding sales volumes.
- **Examine customer behavior:** Analyze customer purchasing habits, such as average order size, frequency of visits, and preferred payment methods.
- **Identify revenue drivers:** Identify the key factors contributing to the restaurant's revenue, including high-margin products and successful marketing campaigns.
- **Provide recommendations:** Offer data-driven recommendations to improve sales, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize business operations.
